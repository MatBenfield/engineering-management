SMART is a mnemonic/acronym, giving criteria to guide in the asking of questions, to aid getting help, getting answers etc.

## Smart

- **Specific**: target one area clearly and precisely - this triggers people's memories/knowledge correctly
- **Meaningful**: why of the request, never assume that is already understood - this helps provide transparency and also builds trust
- **Actionable**: what needs to be done.
- **Realistic (strategically)**: be in the realm of possibility.
- **Timely**: give a deadline if it exists

Think about the goal, what do you want to achieve. What do you need to accomplish that goal. Then formulate a request using the smart template above.

SMART criteria are commonly associated with Peter Drucker's management by objectives concept.

Alternative acronum words:

- **S**: Specific, Strategic
- **M**: Measurable, Motivating, Meaningful
- **A**: Actionable, Achievable, Assignable, Attainable, Agreed, Ambitious, Aligned
- **R**: Relevant, Realistic, Resourced, Reasonable, Results-based
- **T**: Timely, Timeframe, Time-boxed, Trackable, Testable
