# Warn-up : No Money

## Premise

* If Money were suddenly to become obsolete and unnecessary, what would make you want to carry on working in this this team?
* How can you get more of that?

## Session

1. Spend no more than 5 minutes posing and asking everyone to answer the question 
2. Going around the room give everyone a minute to answer
3. Ask the group the follow up question and give 5 minutes for a collaborative answer
    * Add this to the sprint board or team area to remind the team
