# Warm-up : 20-20

You have 20 seconds to work out how your team can count to 20.

## Rules

* Only one team member can speak at once
* Every team member must speak
* You must always have your eyes closed.
* The person who starts with “1” must also finish with “20”.

If you break the rules you must start again.
