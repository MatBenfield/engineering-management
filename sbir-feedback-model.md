Putting words together to give positive feedback is hard! You know the emotions you feel but lack the words.

To organize my thoughts, I use the SBIR Framework. This acronym defines the structure of how to deliver positive feedback:

Situation: State the specific situation where you observed the behaviour.
Behaviour: Explain the precise behaviour you saw.
Impact: Describe the exact impact the personâ€™s actions had on you.
Request: State the explicit request you would like to make of the person.
