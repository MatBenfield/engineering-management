# Optimising for teams

- We work in small cross-functional teams with a focus on collaboration
- With psychological safety
- Encouraging open and honest feedback in a caring way ([Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/))

- Trust (sharing vulnerabilities with the group)
- Embrace conflict (utilising constructive and passionate debate over feigning agreement and "I don't mind")
- Commitment (by disagreeing and committing whole-heartedly to the team decision)
- Accountability (by calling out peers, leaders, or counterproductive behaviours to raise standards over ducking responsibility and blaming others)
- Pay attention to results (by focusing on team success over personal success, status, and ego).

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand. - The Prime Directive.

We take every opportunity keep people informed and to teach/coach/support our teammates.
